# React package

This package allows you to integrate Jacdac into React applications.
The package exposes **JDOM**, a dependency-free JavaScript object model
that reflects the state of the Jacdac elements and allows sending commands as well.
JDOM also handles connection through WebUSB, WebBLE and other transports.

To read guides and overview documents about JDOM, go to [JDOM documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/jacdac-docs/clients/javascript/jdom).
